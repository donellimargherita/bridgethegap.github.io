				<p id="intro"><i>Lecture about wine making - it is a lecture that should serve as a motivational starting lecture, introducing the broad subject of wine making industry, that is a substantial part of the program for students of Agricultural science school (in Italy “Istituto Agrario”)</i></p>
				
				<h5>How people think the wine is made? And how it is actually made?</h5><h6> From Middle Age codices to modern wine industry</h6>
					<p>The common perception of wine making is very basic, with images including grape cultivation, harvesting as a ceremony and big cask/barrel for the storage.  This imagery comes from Middle Age iconography and representation of the various process involved in wine making. And it should be said this is not a misconception: the wine making techniques formalised during Middle Age have been untouched until the Industrialisation of the second part of the 20th century.</p> <p>In this lecture we will see the different steps of wine making and how these have changed in the model enologic industry, giving and idea of how complex it is now to produce wine and why it should be studied thoroughly.</p>
				  <div class="row">
					<div class="col">
					  <p><i><b> Harvesting</b></i><p>
					  <p>During Middle Age, the start of the harvesting period was regulated by the community law or ordered by the leader of the community. This measure was adopted to publicly control of operations and  prevent  stealing or early harvesting due to the lack of wine.  Usually, the leader was represented by Church people, like masters of Abbeys, and anyways, the harvesting was considered a feast for the whole community and blessed by the Church: most of the years it was on the same date of Saint Mary’s day, on the 8th of September. This last consideration can explain why most of the illustration from Middle Age codices represent grape harvesting as something ordered from above, as shown in the picture.</p> 
					</div>
					<div class="col">
					 <p>This is obviously different in modern times. The best moment for the harvesting is chosen by the single wine maker. Several factors are to be considered: seasonal pattern, the ideal ripening level for the expected type of wine – red, white or raisin wine (passito). For red wines, the grape should be at its maximum volume, with a pH ranging from 3,2 and 3,3. For white wines, the harvest has to start a bit earlier, when the pH values is 2,9-3,0 ( or 2,8-3,2 for spumante wines). Sweet vines or passito require over-ripen grapes: it will have a higher rate of sugar and will allow to produce a wine with an higher alcoholic content.</p><p>The best way to harvest was and still is hand picking. But it requires a huge work force: if during the Middle age this problem was solved involving the whole community for some days, on the contrary now a days this lead some wine makers to use automatic or semiautomatic systems like shaker-machines.</p>

						<p><i><b>Grape processing</b></i><p>
						<p>The subsequent operation is the pressing (pigiatura). The common imagery is the one representing people inside big wooden wine tanks walking on the grapes in order to press the fruits and extract the juice directly on the field. Once again, this is derived from the ancient wine making process and the middle age codices helped building this iconography. </p><p>In modern times the grapes are transported from the field to the wine cellar and only there are processed.</p> 
						<p>Here, there are dedicated rooms for every stage of the process:
					  <ul>
						<li>The mash tun room. Here – and not on the fields anymore – the grapes are pressed .</li> 
						<li>The fermentation room. Where the wine tanks are stored to rest and allow the fermentation.</li>
						<li>The maturation room. The storage for barrels filled with wine. It is important that this room should not be isolated, but should be able to perceive the different climates due to seasons since this changes are crucial for the wine maturation.</li> 
						<li>The wine cellar (itself). Usually it is placed underneath the floor level because it should be isolated by thermic swings.</li>
						</ul></p> 
					</div>
					<div class="col">
						<p>The last two rooms existed in the wineries of the Middle ages as well. The maturation rooms full of barrels was usually placed not in a dedicated winery, but in the context of a farm or better in the large building of the city administration or in the cellars of the castles.</p><p>
						These rooms are ( and were before) the house of all the different containers used in the winery, called “ vats “ or simply wine containers. The principal categories of vats are:
							<ul><li>The wine tanks, used for the first fermentation. Usually are open in the upper side</li>
							<li>The barrels or casks are used for processing and maturation of wine. They are characterised by a  rounded , oval or elliptic section; an upper hole for checking the level of the wine and a lower aperture for cleaning between a harvest and the other. The building material are wooden stripes. The capacity can vary with the desired use but it usually is greater than 2 hL.<p><i>The 3d model can help us understand better how the barrel is made, also from the inside. This particular barrel is a toy example of little dimensions, handmade in Sardinia. </i></p></li></ul></</p>

			<h6>The idea</h6>
			<p>The project idea starts from a gap. Digital humanities projects are multiplying around the web, are very much useful for the research but the diffusion of them in the school education is at a minimum. It is important to recognize that usually the target of the project is just academic, but at the same time is evident that we are facing a revolution in the schools. The revolution is due to the pandemic that partially changed the modalities of fruition of schools and classrooms during the emergency. But I think that out of the emergency, some changes are here to last.</p> 
			<p>The multimedia objects have entered the classroom and have been discovered by educators as a powerful tool.</p> 
			<p>It is important to say that multimedia entered the classroom in a sparse way, coming from different sources and usually not reliable ones, not conforming to particular standards and copyright laws and delivered through inconsistent formats and stored – usually – in an uncanny way.</p>
			<p>In spite of this, there actually are a great number of institutions that are making available to the public their collections via multimedia items and there are doing that for free. The gap I see is the one between the educators and the institution providing multimedia objects that could be useful for teaching.</p>
			<p>This project is supposed to suggest a solution to fill that gap.</p> 
			<h6>The project</h6>
			<p>The mediator between institutions and educators should be the public local library or the school library. The library should be the house of the project in terms of both creation and dissemination.</p> 
			<p>The actors involved in the project should be educators and librarians and/or digital humanists: the educators know the teaching programs and the level and the needs of the target students, while the librarians with digital competencies know best the collections, where and how to explore them in the network of institutions and in which way making them available to the educators. The team configured as said should provide as output a series of “lessons” based on the teaching goals and empowered by the correct use of reliable multimedia.</p> 

			<h6>The digital object creation</h6>
			<p>The output is realised through different technologies, handled by the digital humanist.</p> 
			<p>The main tool is the html language. Each lesson will be represented by a single html page that can be easily shared if stable. In terms of infrastructure, a solution could be a web site hosted by the servers of the pilot library of the project and accessible to every user registered to a library joining the network project. The pages could be organised following the criterion of school subjects and levels of education.
			The textual content of the lesson will be then stored and encoded as html.<p> 
	
			<p>With respect to the multimedia objects involved, two main frameworks are used. 
			
			<p>The first one is the iiif (International Image Interoperability Framework) framework for image sharing. Is it a community based initiative with the goal of developing applications and technologies to make the most out of all the different cultural heritage digital collections. In this particular project iiif allows to easily embed images or details of manuscripts from different institutions and libraries digital collections in the html page</p> 
			
			<p>The second one is dedicated to the visualisation of 3D models. These models are useful when the material heritage is involved and can be generated directly by the institutions for this specific purpose, but there is a number of them that are already available thanks to museums or platforms like Sketchfab or CARARE service by Europeana.</p> 
			<p>The 3d model is embedded into the html page thanks to the Sketchfab platform that generates code for each publicity available model in the cloud. 
			It is also possible to directly insert glTF models in html pages through js libraries like three.js (and more advanced coding skills). 
			</p>

			<h6>Replicability </h6>
			<p>The lessons follow a quite simple structure with textual content, the iiif images and a 3d model from Sketchfab platform. In the prototype the multimedia contents are embedded via simple html code lines: the code for the images has been kindly provided by Tiziana Mancinelli and follow the iiif standard and the html praxis, while the code for the 3d model embedding is generated automatically by the sharing platform via iFrame.
			<p>All the compotents are harmonized and structured in the html page using Bootstrap, that also provides responsive layout and thus adaptability to different media supports.</p><p>In conclusion, the replicability is easily obtained if the html code is perceived as a template to fill with new content for every specific lesson.
