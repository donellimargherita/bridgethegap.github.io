			<h6>The idea</h6>
			<p>The project idea starts from a gap. Digital humanities projects are multiplying around the web, are very much useful for the research but the diffusion of them in the school education is at a minimum. It is important to recognize that usually the target of the project is just academic, but at the same time is evident that we are facing a revolution in the schools. The revolution is due to the pandemic that partially changed the modalities of fruition of schools and classrooms during the emergency. But I think that out of the emergency, some changes are here to last.</p> 
			<p>The multimedia objects have entered the classroom and have been discovered by educators as a powerful tool.</p> 
			<p>It is important to say that multimedia entered the classroom in a sparse way, coming from different sources and usually not reliable ones, not conforming to particular standards and copyright laws and delivered through inconsistent formats and stored – usually – in an uncanny way.</p>
			<p>In spite of this, there actually are a great number of institutions that are making available to the public their collections via multimedia items and there are doing that for free. The gap I see is the one between the educators and the institution providing multimedia objects that could be useful for teaching.</p>
			<p>This project is supposed to suggest a solution to fill that gap.</p> 
			<h6>The project</h6>
			<p>The mediator between institutions and educators should be the public local library or the school library. The library should be the house of the project in terms of both creation and dissemination.</p> 
			<p>The actors involved in the project should be educators and librarians and/or digital humanists: the educators know the teaching programs and the level and the needs of the target students, while the librarians with digital competencies know best the collections, where and how to explore them in the network of institutions and in which way making them available to the educators. The team configured as said should provide as output a series of “lessons” based on the teaching goals and empowered by the correct use of reliable multimedia.</p> 

			<h6>The digital object creation</h6>
			<p>The output is realised through different technologies, handled by the digital humanist.</p> 
			<p>The main tool is the html language. Each lesson will be represented by a single html page that can be easily shared if stable. In terms of infrastructure, a solution could be a web site hosted by the servers of the pilot library of the project and accessible to every user registered to a library joining the network project. The pages could be organised following the criterion of school subjects and levels of education.
			The textual content of the lesson will be then stored and encoded as html.<p> 
	
			<p>With respect to the multimedia objects involved, two main frameworks are used. 
			
			<p>The first one is the iiif (International Image Interoperability Framework) framework for image sharing. Is it a community based initiative with the goal of developing applications and technologies to make the most out of all the different cultural heritage digital collections. In this particular project iiif allows to easily embed images or details of manuscripts from different institutions and libraries digital collections in the html page</p> 
			
			<p>The second one is dedicated to the visualisation of 3D models. These models are useful when the material heritage is involved and can be generated directly by the institutions for this specific purpose, but there is a number of them that are already available thanks to museums or platforms like Sketchfab or CARARE service by Europeana.</p> 
			<p>The 3d model is embedded into the html page thanks to the Sketchfab platform that generates code for each publicity available model in the cloud. 
			It is also possible to directly insert glTF models in html pages through js libraries like three.js (and more advanced coding skills). 
			</p>

			<h6>Replicability </h6>
			<p>The lessons follow a quite simple structure with textual content, the iiif images and a 3d model from Sketchfab platform. In the prototype the multimedia contents are embedded via simple html code lines: the code for the images has been kindly provided by Tiziana Mancinelli and follow the iiif standard and the html praxis, while the code for the 3d model embedding is generated automatically by the sharing platform via iFrame.
			<p>All the compotents are harmonized and structured in the html page using Bootstrap, that also provides responsive layout and thus adaptability to different media supports.</p><p>In conclusion, the replicability is easily obtained if the html code is perceived as a template to fill with new content for every specific lesson.
