<p> -	Project  illustration
the project idea starts from a gap. Digital humanities projects are multiplying around the web, are very much useful for the research but the diffusion of them in the school education is at a minimum. It is important to recognize that usually the target of the project is just academic, but at the same time is evident that we are facing a revolution in the schools. The revolution is due to the pandemic that partially changed the modalities of fruition of schools and classrooms during the emergency. But I think that out of the emergency, some changes are here to last. The multimedia objects have entered the classroom and have been discovered by educators as a powerful tool. 
it is important to say that multimedia entered the classroom in a sparse way, coming from different sources and usually not reliable ones, not conforming to particular standards and copyright laws and delivered through inconsistent formats and stored – usually – in an uncanny way. In spite of this, there actually are a great number of institutions that are making available to the public their collections via multimedia items and there are doing that for free. The gap I see is the one between the educators and the institution providing multimedia objects that could be useful for teaching. 
This project is supposed to suggest a solution to fill that gap. 
The mediator between institutions and educators should be the public local library or the school library. The library should be the house of the project in terms of both creation and dissemination. 
The actors involved in the project should be educators and librarians and/or digital humanists: the educators know the teaching programs and the level and the needs of the target students, while the librarias with digital competencies know best the collections, where and how to explore them in the network of institutions and in which way making them available to the educators. The team configured as said should provide as output a series of “lessons” based on the teaching goals and empowered by the correct use of reliable multimedia. 
-	OUTPUT – which technologies and how were used?
The output is realised through different technologies, handled by the digital humanist. 
The main tool is the html language. Each lesson will be represented by a single html page that can be easily shared if stable. In terms of infrastructure, a solution could be a web site hosted by the servers of the pilot library of the project and accessible to every user registered to a library joining the network project. The pages could be organised following the criterion of school subjects and levels of education. 
The textual content of the lesson will be then stored and encoded as html.
With respect to the multimedia objects involved, two main frameworks are used. 
The first one is the iiif framework for image sharing (SEE WEBSITE) 

The second one is dedicated to the visualisation of 3D models. These models are useful when the material heritage in involved and can be generated directly by the institutions for this specific purpose, but there is a number of them that are already available thanks to museums or platforms like…..

How is the structure replicable.
